# staff-detection
Trying to detect the staff (wearing nametag) as an evaluation test from Footfallcam. These texts are copied directly from their test.

A person is identified as a staff if he/she is wearing a staff name tag, as shown below.

As an AI Engineer, you have a few hundred of video samples from our 3D sensor. Here, you are given 1 sample
(“sample.mp4”) which is the view from our 3D sensor. Within the clip, there is a person wearing the tag and walking
along the corridor. Below are 2 snapshot instances of the person, all other people are not wearing the tag:
